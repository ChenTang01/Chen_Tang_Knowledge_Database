Using data from an online retailer's keyword advertising campaign, we measure the impact of organic competition on both click-through rate and conversion rate of sponsored search advertisements. We find that an increase in organic competition leads to a decrease in the click performance of sponsored advertisements. However, organic competition helps the conversion performance of sponsored ads and leads to higher revenue. We also find that organic competition has a higher negative effect on click performance than does sponsored competition. Our results inform advertisers on how the presence of organic results influences the performance of their sponsored advertisements. Specifically, we show that organic competition acts as a substitute for clicks, but has a complementary effect on the conversion performance.},

We differentiate between the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from friends (``personal network'') and the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from the whole community (``community network''). Understanding the relative importance of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions at each network level provides crucial guidance for companies regarding their information provision and platform design strategies. Our unique data come from an online anime (Japanese cartoon) platform containing individual-level data on users' networks, anime adoptions, forum posts, and ratings of animes. Our results reveal that both word-of-mouth (volume and valence) and observed adoptions from the community network have significant positive effects on individual users' anime watching decisions. Furthermore, this finding also holds true for word-of-mouth and observed adoptions coming from the personal network. Comparing the magnitudes of the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions across both network levels, we find that word-of-mouth valence from the community network is the largest driver among the social learning forces we study. Thus our results show that word-of-mouth and observed adoptions provide unique and different information that individuals use in their anime watching decisions and that the community network is the primary source of information.},

  abstract = {Pricing and availability of tickets have always been a source of confusion for customers in transportation industries. What is the best time to buy tickets? Why passengers taking the same flight might pay significantly different prices for the same seat? Why round trip tickets between two cities sometimes become cheaper than the one-way flights between them? Is it fair to buy a ticket for an itinerary cheaper than a ticket for just a part of it? These observations make customers wonder why they pay higher prices for shorter flights. In this paper, we study the airlines' revenue management systems and explain some of these pricing schemes in travel industries. We develop a simulator to study the decision making process of network revenue management and use a numerical study to explore these questions and address some explanations for them. We relate these observations to the revenue management measurements such as the bid price or the adjustment cost and show how the dynamic of the network get influenced by these measures that eventually results in unusual pricing. We explain how a zero or small bid price of a specific leg may cause the price of an itinerary be cheaper than one segment of it and that the small bid price is caused by low demand in comparison to the available capacity. We exhibit network revenue management system and show the above issues for a small network.},

A conceptual framework separates short- and long-term effects by analyzing the capabilities of a channel that help consumers accomplish their shopping goals. To test the theory, the authors analyze a unique data set from a high-end retailer using matching methods. The authors study the introduction of a retail store and find evidence of cross-channel cannibalization and synergy. The presence of a retail store decreases sales in the catalog but not the Internet channel in the short run but increases sales in both direct channels over time. Following the opening of the store, more first-time customers begin purchasing in the direct channels. These results suggest that adding a retail store to direct channels yields different results from adding an Internet channel to a retail store channel, as previous research has indicated.},

  abstract = {We introduce the refined assortment optimization problem where a firm may decide to make some of its products harder to get instead of making them unavailable as in the traditional assortment optimization problem. Airlines, for example, offer fares with severe restrictions rather than making them unavailable. This is a more subtle way of handling the trade-off between demand induction and demand cannibalization. For the latent class MNL model, a firm that engages in refined assortment optimization can make up to min(n, m) times more than one that insists on traditional assortment optimization, where n is the number of products and m the number of customer types. Surprisingly, the revenue-ordered assortment heuristic has the same performance guarantees relative to personalized refined assortment optimization as it does to traditional assortment optimization. Based on this finding, we construct refinements of the revenue-order heuristic and measure their improved performance relative to the revenue-ordered assortment and the optimal traditional assortment optimization problem. We also provide tight bounds on the ratio of the expected revenues for the refined versus the traditional assortment optimization for some well known discrete choice models.},

Because search clicks and purchase intent are correlated, we show that returns from paid search are a fraction of non-experimental estimates. As an extreme case, we show that brand keyword ads have no measurable short-term benefits. For non-brand keywords, we find that new and infrequent users are positively influenced by ads but that more frequent users whose purchasing behavior is not influenced by ads account for most of the advertising expenses, resulting in average returns that are negative.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to modeling consumer response to banner ad exposures at a sponsored content Web site that reveals significant heterogeneity in (unobservable) click proneness across consumers. The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off at higher levels of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and banner exposure sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit over a longer period of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions. Our results have implications for online advertising response measurement and dynamic ad placement, and may help guide advertising media placement decisions.},

The authors merged minute-by-minute brand search and price search data with spot-level TV advertisement data for the three leading pickup truck brands in the United States over an 11-month period. They presented a generalizable modeling framework and used it to estimate the size and variation of immediate online responses to TV ads. The average elasticity of brand search to a brand's own national ads is .09, and the average elasticity of price search to a brand's own national ads is .03. Given ad audience size, immediate search responses vary with ad creative characteristics, audience category interest, slot of the break, program genre, and time factors. Overall, the results show that ordinary TV ads lead to a variety of immediate online responses and that advertisers can use these signals to enrich their media planning and campaign evaluations.},

Consequently, the selection of products offered offline affects the demand in both channels. We address how firms should select an optimal offline assortment to maximize profits across both channels; we call this the showcase decision problem. We incorporate the impact of physical evaluation on preferences into the consumer demand model. Under this model, we show that the decision problem is NP-hard. Analytically, we derive optimal results for special cases and near-optimal approximations for general cases. Empirically, we use conjoint analysis to identify changes in consumer preferences resulting from physically evaluating products. For this application, we demonstrate gains in expected revenue of up to 40\% due to accounting for the impact of offline assortment on the online sales.

  abstract = {A retailer following a competition-based dynamic-pricing strategy tracks competitors' price changes and then must answer the following questions: (i) Should we respond? (ii) If so, to whom? (iii) How much of a response? (iv) And on which products? The answers require unbiased measures of price elasticity as well as accurate estimates of competitor significance and the extent to which consumers compare prices across retailers. There are two key challenges to quantify these factors empirically: first, the endogeneity associated with almost any type of observational data, where prices are correlated with demand shocks observable to pricing managers but not to researchers, and second, the absence of competitor sales information, which prevents efficient estimation of a full consumer-choice model. We address the first issue by conducting a field experiment with randomized prices. We resolve the second issue by exploiting the retailer's own and competitors' stockouts as a source of variation to the consumer choice set, in addition to variations in competitors' prices. We estimate an empirical model capturing consumer choices among substitutable products from multiple retailers. Based on the estimates, we propose and test a best-response pricing strategy through a carefully controlled live experiment that lasts five weeks. The experiment documents an 11\% revenue increase while maintaining a margin above a retailer-specified target. The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2753.

The new framework is developed on the basis of general underlying distributions and a finite simulation budget. It adopts the expected opportunity cost (EOC) quality measure, which, compared to the traditional probability of correct selection (PCS) measure, penalizes a particularly bad choice more than a slightly incorrect selection, and is thus preferred by risk-neutral practitioners and decision makers. To this end, we establish a closed-form approximation of EOC to formulate the budget allocation problem and derive the corresponding optimality conditions. A sequential budget allocation algorithm is then developed for implementation. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical experiments. We also link the EOC and PCS-based budget allocation problems by showing that the two are asymptotically equivalent. This result explains, to some extent, the similarity in performance between the EOC and PCS allocation procedures observed in the literature.

In this paper, we build a structural econometric model to quantify the vibrant platform competition between mobile (smartphone and tablet) apps on the Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and estimate consumer preferences toward different mobile app characteristics. We find that app demand increases with the in-app purchase option wherein a user can complete transactions within the app. On the contrary, app demand decreases with the in-app advertisement option where consumers are shown ads while they are engaging with the app. The direct effects on app revenue from the inclusion of an in-app purchase option and an in-app advertisement option are equivalent to offering a 28\% price discount and increasing the price by 8\%, respectively. We also find that a price discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Google Play compared with Apple App Store, and app developers can maximize their revenue by providing a 50\% discount on their paid apps. Using the estimated demand function, we find that mobile apps have enhanced consumer surplus by approximately \$33.6 billion annually in the United States, and we discuss various implications for mobile marketing analytics, app pricing, and app design strategies.

  abstract = {Business analytics has evolved from being a novelty used by a select few to an accepted facet of conducting business. Recommender systems form a critical component of the business analytics toolkit and, by enabling firms to effectively target customers with products and services, are helping alter the e-commerce landscape. A variety of methods exist for providing recommendations, with collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and association-rule-based methods being the most common. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of recommendations made using association rules. This is accomplished by combining rules when possible and stands apart from existing rule-combination methods in that it is strongly grounded in probability theory. Combining rules requires the identification of the best combination of rules from the many combinations that might exist, and we use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. Because it is impractical to apply the maximum likelihood framework directly in real time, we show that this problem can equivalently be represented as a set partitioning problem by translating it into an information theoretic context---the best solution corresponds to the set of rules that leads to the highest sum of mutual information associated with the rules. Through a variety of experiments that evaluate the quality of recommendations made using the proposed approach, we show that (i) a greedy heuristic used to solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem is very effective, providing results comparable to those from using the optimal set partitioning solution; (ii) the recommendations made by our approach are more accurate than those made by a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization; and (iii) the recommendations can be made in a fraction of a second on a desktop computer, making it practical to use in real-world applications.},

To isolate exogenous exposure to peers' product adoptions, we leverage the app's quasi-random matchmaking system. Observing a friend's product adoption has twice the marginal e ect on purchase probability as observing a stranger's product adoption, but the cumulative e ect from observing strangers' product adoptions is much larger over time. We then calibrate a di usion model using the in-app social network of 9.4 million players. We nd that seeding products to active players who interact with more strangers generates almost four times the number of net new adoptions compared to seeding to players who are more central in the social network.},

Others posit that dealer services are a commodity, and their quality may only affect sales in the extremes. We constructed data representing sales and service quality ratings of 1078 U.S. automobile dealerships over a year in five different car classes. We find that the quality of after-sales services positively influences sales of the brand in the dealer's region. Manufacturers whose dealers struggle with after-sales services take a hit in market share even in markets where they enjoy superior competitive status. We also find that sales-related services gain importance in highly competitive markets where the manufacturer has few dealers and competitors have many.},

Our results indicate significant cannibalization across the two channels as well as significant diminishing returns to impressions within each channel. This suggests that under certain conditions both channels may need to be used to optimize returns to advertising both for advertisers and service providers such as Google. Our game theoretic analysis which builds upon our empirical findings reveals that for intermediate budget values it is optimal to use both channels whereas for very low (very high) budget values it is optimal to use only the content (search) channel. Further as budget increases the advertiser should offer more for ads displayed on the search channel to optimally incentivize the service provider.},

However, we find that cannibalization of the offline channel moderately increases as markets become more concentrated. These results together suggest that airlines can benefit from opaque offerings mainly in markets with high levels of competition. Further, we develop a methodology to assess the revenue impacts of the opaque channel and show how it can be used by managers to develop and implement pricing tactics to increase demand and decrease cannibalization.},

  abstract = {Despite the fast growing popularity of in-game purchases of virtual currency (to obtain game enhancing virtual items) in digital games, there is very limited formal research that studies this new business model and its impacts on players' gameplay behavior and social welfare. This paper builds upon the classic labor-leisure model to capture players' dual experience of enjoying leisure and earning virtual currency when playing digital games. We examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior and social welfare, relating players' demand for in-game virtual currency to three key game characteristics -- virtual wealth satiation point, rate of generating virtual currency, and rate of generating leisure. Our results suggest that the game provider can increase her profits by reducing the virtual currency's price and increasing the number of available virtual items. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing times for the majority of players, which helps alleviate the risk of excessive gaming. Selling virtual currency also leads to a larger player base and more people enjoy the many benefits from playing digital games. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a ``win-win-win'' situation for the game provider, players, and society.},

We investigate the assortment, space and inventory problem for an omni-channel retailer operating with interconnected bricks-and-mortar stores and an online shop. For this problem it becomes essential to consider customers' demand interactions across channels. Current literature mainly focuses on single-channel assortments and ignores cross-channel substitution. We contribute the first integrated omni-channel model that determines assortments for the online and bricks-and-mortar channel with stochastic, space-elastic and out-of-assortment and out-of-stock demand both for in-channel substitution and cross-channel substitution. A specialized heuristic is developed that is based on an iterative solution of a binary problem and demand updates. Our approach achieves near-optimal results for small instances and higher objective values as an alternative heuristic for larger instances. With the full integration of channels, omni-channel retailers can realize a profit increase that mainly depends on the magnitude of substitution rates. We further show numerically that in-channel substitution has a stronger impact on profits than cross-channel substitution when costs are equal across channels.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel two-stage data analytic modeling approach, combining theories, statistical analysis and optimization techniques to model player engagement as a function of motivation to maximize customer game-play via matching in the large and growing online video game industry. In the first stage, we build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers' latent engagement state and the state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal dataset obtained from a major international video gaming company, which contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing history over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium- and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer's current engagement state ``on the fly'' and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4-8\% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.},

  abstract = {The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group's realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents' preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms, and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have of others' preferences and actions.},

In particular, we propose constant-factor approximation algorithms for maximizing the revenue that can be obtained from these deals when offered to all or a subset of the advertisers, whose valuation distributions can be independent or correlated through a common value component. We evaluate our algorithms using data from Google's ad exchange platform and show they perform better than the approximation guarantees and obtain significantly higher revenue than auctions; in certain cases, the observed revenue is 85\%--96\% of the optimal revenue achievable. We also prove the NP-hardness of designing deals when advertisers' valuations are arbitrarily correlated and the optimality of menus of deals among a certain class of selling mechanisms in an incomplete distributional information setting.},

We observe that, under both problems, decision makers deviate significantly from normative benchmarks. Furthermore, revenue management decisions are consistently higher compared to the newsvendor order quantities. In the face of increasing demand variability, revenue managers increase allocations; this behavior is consistent with normative patterns when the ratio of the selling prices of the two customer segments is less than 1/2, but is its exact opposite when this ratio is greater than 1/2. Newsvendors' behavior with respect to changing demand variability, on the other hand, is consistent with normative trends. We also observe that losses due to leftovers weigh more in newsvendor decisions compared to the revenue management model; we argue that overage cost is more salient in the newsvendor problem because it is perceived as a direct loss, and propose this as the driver of the differences in behavior observed under the two problems.},

  abstract = {How does the monetary value of customer purchases vary by customer preference for purchase channels (e.g., traditional, electronic, multichannel) and product category? The authors develop a conceptual model and hypotheses on the moderating effects of two key product category characteristics---the utilitarian versus hedonic nature of the product category and perceived risk---on the channel preference--monetary value relationship. They test the hypotheses on a unique large-scale, empirically generalizable data set in the retailing context. Contrary to conventional wisdom that all multichannel customers are more valuable than single-channel customers, the results show that multichannel customers are the most valuable segment only for hedonic product categories. The findings reveal that traditional channel customers of low-risk categories provide higher monetary value than other customers. Moreover, for utilitarian product categories perceived as high (low) risk, web-only (catalog- or store-only) shoppers constitute the most valuable segment. The findings offer managers guidelines for targeting and migrating different types of customers for different product categories through different channels.},

  abstract = {We describe the effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement using data from Facebook. We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement---defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs---with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality---like humor and emotion---is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content---like mentions of price and deals---is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality--related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers' path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook's EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook's behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality--related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodology we apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.

  abstract = {The benefits of recommendation systems in online retail contexts have received much attention in prior work. Much of this work has been conducted in personal computer (PC)--based settings, although mobile devices are becoming increasingly central to the online shopping experience. It remains to be examined if the effects of recommendation systems in retail differ across these two channels, in terms of customer-level decision outcomes. In this paper, we examine these differences in some detail, studying how product views and sales attributed to a recommendation system are different across mobile and PC-based channels. Further, we examine how the effect of a recommendation system across channels influences sales diversity, an important outcome in the retail industry. We conduct our analysis using a randomized field experiment, conducted in partnership with an online retailing firm in South Korea, where the experimental treatment is access to a recommendation system. Our results show that the use of recommendation systems enhances customer-level outcomes, such as views and sales of recommended products, clickthrough rate, and conversion. More importantly, the marginal impacts of the recommendation system are significantly higher for mobile users, indicating that the higher search costs imposed through mobile devices are more effectively reduced through recommendation systems. With respect to sales diversity, we observe that although the mobile channel leads to more diverse sales, we see no interaction effects of the recommendation system and mobile use on sales diversity. These results provide boundary conditions for the efficacy of recommendation systems in retail contexts where online sales occur across both PC-based and mobile channels. We discuss the managerial implications of these results for online retailers and conclude with opportunities for further research.},

  abstract = {We investigate the moderating effect of product attributes and review ratings on views, conversion{\textbar}views (conversion conditional on views), and final conversion of a purchase-based collaborative filtering recommender system on an e-commerce site. We run a randomized field experiment on a top retailer with 184,375 users split into a recommender-treated group and a control group. We tag theory-driven attributes of 37,125 unique products via Amazon Mechanical Turk to augment the usual product data (e.g., review ratings, descriptions). By examining the recommender's impact through different stages---awareness (views), salience (conversion{\textbar}views), and final conversion---and across product types, we provide nuanced insights. The study confirms that the recommender increases views, conversion{\textbar}views, and final conversion rates by 15.3\%, 21.6\%, and 7.5\%, respectively, but this lift is moderated by product attributes and review ratings. We find that the lift on product views is greater for utilitarian products compared with hedonic products as well as for experience products compared with search products. In contrast, the lift on conversion{\textbar}views rate is greater for hedonic products compared with utilitarian products. Furthermore, the lift on views rate is greater for products with higher average review ratings, which suggests that a recommender acts as a complement to review ratings, whereas the opposite is true for conversion{\textbar}views, where recommender and review ratings are substitutes. Additionally, a recommender's awareness lift is greater than its saliency impact. We discuss the potential mechanisms behind our results as well as their managerial implications.

  abstract = {We consider an e-commerce retailer (e-tailer) who sells a catalog of products to customers from different regions during a finite selling season and fulfills orders through multiple fulfillment centers. The e-tailer faces a joint pricing and fulfillment (JPF) optimization problem: at the beginning of each period, the e-tailer needs to jointly decide the price for each product and how to fulfill an incoming order (i.e., from which warehouse to ship the order). The objective of the e-tailer is to maximize its total expected profits defined as total expected revenues minus total expected shipping costs. (All other costs are fixed in this problem.) The exact optimal policy for JPF is difficult to solve; so, we propose two heuristic controls that have provably good performance compared to reasonable benchmarks. Our first heuristic control directly uses the solution of a deterministic approximation of JPF as its control parameters. Our second heuristic control improves the first one by adaptively adjusting the original control parameters according to the realized demand. An important feature of the second heuristic control is that it decouples the real-time pricing and fulfillment decisions, making it easy to implement. We show theoretically and numerically that the second heuristic control significantly outperforms the first heuristic control and is very close to a benchmark that jointly reoptimizes the full deterministic problem at the beginning of every period.

This paper analyzes the sample average approximation (SAA) approach for the data-driven newsvendor problem. We obtain a new analytical bound on the probability that the relative regret of the SAA solution exceeds a threshold. This bound is significantly tighter than existing bounds, and it matches the empirical accuracy of the SAA solution observed in extensive computational experiments. This bound reveals that the demand distribution's weighted mean spread affects the accuracy of the SAA heuristic.},

However, firms still depend on aggregate measures to guide their marketing investments in multiple online channels (e.g., display, paid search, referral, e-mail). This article introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data of customers' touches. The authors propose a measurement model to analyze customers' (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to different channels and find that these channels' relative contributions are significantly different from those found by other currently used metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions. In targeting customers with different patterns of touches in their purchase funnel, these estimates help identify cases in which retargeting strategies may actually decrease conversion probabilities.},

However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms ina competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firmand apply itto valuation of firmsoperating incompetitive industries. The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role of customer equity invaluations of growing service firms.},

More and more practitioners are employing this strategy, given the increasing availability of technologies that enable coordination across advertising channels in real time. However, very little is known about the instant impact of TV advertising on the effectiveness of search advertising. We take advantage of a unique opportunity for causal estimation in this research area by leveraging large exogenous variation in TV advertising expenditure over a long period, while at the same time having access to granular consumer search data under relatively stable sponsored search advertising strategies. Utilizing this novel setup, we provide the first empirical evidence that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Revenue management in railways distinguishes itself from that in traditional sectors, such as airline, hotel, and fashion retail, in several important ways. (i) Capacity is substantially more flexible in the sense that changes to the capacity of a train can often be made throughout the sales horizon. Consequently, the joint optimization of prices and capacity assumes genuine importance. (ii) Capacity can only be added in dis\- crete ``chunks'' (i.e., coaches). (iii) Passengers with unreserved tickets can travel in any of the multiple trains available during the day. Further, passengers in unreserved coaches are allowed to travel by standing, thus giving rise to the need to manage congestion. Moti\- vated by our work with a major railway company in Japan, we analyze the problem of jointly optimizing pricing and capacity; this problem is more-general version of the canoni\- cal multiproduct dynamic-pricing problem. Methodology/results: Our analysis yields four asymptotically optimal policies. From the viewpoint of the pricing decisions, our policies can be classified into two types---static and dynamic. With respect to the timing of the capacity decisions, our policies are again of two types---fixed capacity and flexible capacity. We establish the convergence rates of these policies; when demand and supply ar{\textsurd}e fisfificaled by a factor {$\kappa$} {$\in$} N, the optimality gaps of the static policies scale proportional to {$\kappa$}, and those of the dynamic policies scale proportional to log {$\kappa$}. We illustrate the attractive perfor\- mance of our policies on a test suite of instances based on real-world operations of the high-speed ``Shinkansen'' trains in Japan and develop associated insights. Managerial implications: Our work provides railway administrators with simple and effective policies for pricing, capacity, and congestion management. Our policies cater to different contin\- gencies that decision makers may face in practice: the need for static or dynamic prices and for fixed or flexible capacity.},

  abstract = {We analyze the welfare implications of consumer data sharing, and restrictions to that sharing, in the context of online targeted advertising. Targeting technologies offer firms the ability to reach desired audiences through intermediary platforms. The platforms run auctions in real time to display ads on internet sites, leveraging consumers' personal information collected online to personalize the ads. The online advertising industry posits that targeted advertising benefits advertising firms (that is, merchants who want to target ads to the desired consumers), consumers who see ads for preferred products, and the intermediary platforms that match consumers with firms. However, the claims that targeted advertising benefits all players involved have not been fully vetted in the literature. We develop an analytical model to analyze the economic and welfare implications of targeting technologies for those three players under alternative consumer information regimes. The regimes differ in the type and amount of consumer data available to the intermediary and to the advertising firms, and reflect the presence or absence of technological or regulatory restrictions to personal information flows. We find evidence of incentive misalignment among the players, as the intermediary prefers to share only a subset of consumer information with firms, whereas advertising firms prefer having complete information about the consumers. As such, a strategic intermediary with the ability to control which information is shared during the auction can have an incentive to use only the information that maximizes its payoff, overlooking the interests of both advertising firms and consumers. The information regimes that maximize consumer welfare vastly differ depending on consumers' heterogeneity along two dimensions: a horizontal dimension, capturing consumer's heterogeneity in product preferences; and a vertical dimension, capturing consumers' heterogeneity in purchase power. Consumers prefer none of their personal information to be used for targeting only in limited circumstances. Otherwise, consumers are either indifferent or prefer only specific types of information to be used for targeting.},

We show how path information can be categorized and modeled using a dynamic multinomial probit model of Web browsing. We estimate this model using data from a major online bookseller. Our results show that the memory component of the model is crucial in accurately predicting a path. In comparison, traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a website. One potential application of our model is to predict purchase conversion. We find that after only six viewings purchasers can be predicted with more than 40\% accuracy, which is much better than the benchmark 7\% purchase conversion prediction rate made without path information. This technique could be used to personalize Web designs and product offerings based upon a user's path.},

  abstract = {We study the spread of misinformation in a social network characterized by unequal access to learning resources. Agents use social learning to uncover an unknown state of the world, and a principal strategically injects misinformation into the network to distort this learning process. A subset of agents throughout the network is endowed with knowledge of the true state. This gives rise to a natural definition of inequality: privileged communities have unrestricted access to these agents, whereas marginalized communities do not. We show that the role that this inequality plays in the spread of misinformation is highly complex. For instance, communities who hoard resources and deny them to the larger population can end up exposing themselves to more misinformation. Conversely, although more inequality generally leads to worse outcomes, the prevalence of misinformation in society is nonmonotone in the level of inequality. This implies that policies that decrease inequality without substantially reducing it can leave society more vulnerable to misinformation.

We find that when faced with information on peer choices, consumers update their attribute preferences in a Bayesian manner. This suggests that greater uncertainty in the attribute preferences of a focal consumer and lesser uncertainty in preferences of peers both lead to greater preference revision. Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision, although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable. Online social network membership and frequency of peer interactions provide better proxies than more common demographic similarity measures. These findings have key implications, especially for word-of-mouth marketing.},

  abstract = {Mobile in-app advertising is now the dominant form of digital advertising. Although these ads have excellent user-tracking properties, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a unified modeling framework that consists of two components---a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under counterfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that an efficient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80\% over the current system. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information compared with contextual information. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that although total surplus grows with more granular targeting, the ad network's revenues are nonmonotonic; that is, the most efficient targeting does not maximize ad network revenues. Rather, it is maximized when the ad network does not allow advertisers to engage in behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that ad networks may have economic incentives to preserve users' privacy without external regulation.},

We propose a conceptual framework and develop hypotheses about the effects of the online medium on customer satisfaction and loyalty and on the relationships between satisfaction and loyalty. We test the hypotheses through a simultaneous equation model using two data sets of online and offline customers of the lodging industry. The results are somewhat counterintuitive in that they show that whereas the levels of customer satisfaction for a service chosen online is the same as when it is chosen offline, loyalty to the service provider is higher when the service is chosen online than offline. We also find that loyalty and satisfaction have a reciprocal relationship such that each positively reinforces the other, and this relationship between overall satisfaction and loyalty is further strengthened online.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Games are the fastest-growing sector of the entertainment industry. Freemium games are the fastest-growing segment within games. The concept behind freemium is to attract large pools of players, many of whom will never spend money on the game. When game publishers cannot earn directly from the pockets of consumers, they employ other revenue-generating content, such as advertising. Players can become irritated by revenue-generating content. A recent innovation is to offer incentives for players to interact with such content, such as clicking an ad or watching a video. These are termed incentivized (incented) actions. We study the optimal deployment of incented actions. Academic/practical relevance: Removing or adding incented actions can essentially be done in real-time. Accordingly, the deployment of incented actions is a tactical, operational question for game designers. Methodology: We model the deployment problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study the performance of simple policies, as well as the structure of optimal policies. We use a proprietary data set to calibrate our MDP and derive insights. Results: Cannibalization---the degree to which incented actions distract players from making in-app purchases---is the key parameter for determining how to deploy incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to offer incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently low, it is always optimal to offer. We find sufficient conditions for the optimality of threshold strategies that offer incented actions to low-engagement users and later remove them once a player is sufficiently engaged. Managerial implications: This research introduces operations management academics to a new class of operational issues in the games industry. Managers in the games industry can gain insights into when incentivized actions can be more or less effective. Game designers can use our MDP model to make data-driven decisions for deploying incented actions.},

For this purpose, we first state the choice-based network revenue management problem by formulating the underlying dynamic program, and structure the review according to its components and the resulting inherent challenges. In particular, we first focus on the demand modeling by giving an overview of popular choice models, discussing their properties, and describing estimation procedures relevant to choice-based revenue management. Second, we elaborate on assortment optimization, which is a fundamental component of the problem. Third, we describe recent developments on tackling the entire control problem. We also discuss the relation to dynamic pricing. Finally, we give directions for future research.},

To determine whether the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross-period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find that each of these three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease.},

  abstract = {Network externality arises when the utility of a product depends not only on its attributes but also on the number of consumers who purchase the same product. In this paper, we study consumer choice models that endogenize such network externality. We first characterize the choice probabilities under such models and conduct studies on comparative statics. Then we investigate the assortment optimization problem under such choice models. Although the problem is generally NP-hard, we show that a new class of assortments, called quasi-revenue-ordered assortments, which consist of a revenue-ordered assortment plus at most one additional item, are optimal under mild conditions. We also propose an iterative estimation method to calibrate such choice models, for both uncensored and censored data cases. An empirical study on a mobile game data set shows that our proposed model can provide better fits for the data, increase the prediction accuracy for consumer choices, and potentially increase revenue.

  abstract = {Problem definition: Qualcomm, the largest cellphone chipmaker in the world, had adopted a cross-licensing agreement with its clients, downstream cellphone manufacturers. It requires cellphone manufacturers to allow each other to use their patents for free. This cross-licensing practice has received considerable scrutiny and attention around the world. We study the impacts of cross-licensing in a supply chain in which an upstream supplier requires its downstream competing manufacturers to cross-license, where they are asymmetric in their innovation capabilities. Academic/practical relevance: Our study helps firms and policy makers better understand the implications of cross-licensing and provides practical guidelines. Methodology: We build a stylized model of a supply chain consisting of one supplier and two competing manufacturers, and conduct game-theoretic analysis. Results: The supplier always prefers adopting cross-licensing ex-post after manufacturers' investments are sunk, but it may prefer committing to no cross-licensing ex-ante. Specifically, the supplier should commit to not using cross-licensing if the inferior manufacturer's cost of innovation is high or the effectiveness of cross-licensing is high. Furthermore, cross-licensing may increase innovation, the superior manufacturer's profit, and social welfare under certain conditions. Interestingly, when the superior manufacturer's cost advantage is intermediate, the inferior manufacturer's innovation level first increases andthen decreases in the effectiveness of cross-licensing. In addition, the inferior manufacturer's profit also first increases and then decreases as the effectiveness level of cross-licensing increases. The cross-licensing policy benefits consumers when its effectiveness level is low and the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either high or low. Managerial implications: Our results provide guidance on when a supplier should adopt the cross-licensing strategy. For policy makers, our findings show that cross-licensing can be beneficial forconsumers and the society. In particular, to increase social welfare, policy makers may consider encouraging cross-licensing with low effectiveness level when the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either low or high.},

  abstract = {Social media platforms for healthcare services are changing how patients choose physicians. The digitization of healthcare reviews has been providing additional information to patients when choosing their physicians. On the other hand, the growing online information introduces more uncertainty among providers regarding the expected future demand and how different service features can affect patient decisions. In this paper, we derive various service-quality proxies from online reviews and show that leveraging textual information can derive useful operational measures to better understand patient choices. To do so, we study a unique data set from one of the leading appointment-booking websites in the United States. We derive from the text reviews the seven most frequently mentioned topics among patients, namely, bedside manner, diagnosis accuracy, waiting time, service time, insurance process, physician knowledge, and office environment, and then incorporate these service features into a random-coefficient choice model to quantify the economic values of these service-quality proxies. By introducing quality proxies from text reviews, we find the predictive power of patient choice increases significantly, for example, a 6\%--12\% improvement measured by mean squared error for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, our estimation results indicate that contextual description may better characterize users' perceived quality than numerical ratings on the same service feature. Broadly speaking, this paper shows how to incorporate textual information into an econometric model to understand patient choice in healthcare delivery. Our interdisciplinary approach provides a framework that combines machine learning and structural modeling techniques to advance the literature in empirical operations management, information systems, and marketing.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of paid search advertising has now become the most predominant form of online advertising in the marketing world. However, we have little understanding of the impact of search engine advertising on consumers' responses in the presence of organic listings of the same firms. In this paper, we model and estimate the interrelationship between organic search listings and paid search advertisements. We use a unique panel data set based on aggregate consumer response to several hundred keywords over a three-month period collected from a major nationwide retailer store chain that advertises on Google. In particular, we focus on understanding whether the presence of organic listings on a search engine is associated with a positive, a negative, or no effect on the click-through rates of paid search advertisements, and vice versa for a given firm. We first build an integrated model to estimate the relationship between different metrics such as search volume, click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and keyword ranks. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework is used and the model is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our empirical findings suggest that click-throughs on organic listings have a positive interdependence with click-throughs on paid listings, and vice versa. We also find that this positive interdependence is asymmetric such that the impact of organic clicks on increases in utility from paid clicks is 3.5 times stronger than the impact of paid clicks on increases in utility from organic clicks. Using counterfactual experiments, we show that on an average this positive interdependence leads to an increase in expected profits for the firm ranging from 4.2\% to 6.15\% when compared to profits in the absence of this interdependence. To further validate our empirical results, we also conduct and present the results from a controlled field experiment. This experiment shows that total click-through rates, conversions rates, and revenues in the presence of both paid and organic search listings are significantly higher than those in the absence of paid search advertisements. The results predicted by the econometric model are also corroborated in this field experiment, which suggests a causal interpretation to the positive interdependence between paid and organic search listings. Given the increased spending on search engine-based advertising, our analysis provides critical insights to managers in both traditional and Internet firms.},

However, there is virtually no theoretical framework or systematic evidence that provides insights to platforms on how their business customers use these marketing tools. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework and apply it to an empirical setting to understand how business customers choose between two service offerings (paid search and hot shop) provided by an e-commerce platform. A unique aspect of our modeling framework is that we incorporate two types of heterogeneous strategic considerations in sellers' choice decisions of marketing tools: competitor and consumer reactions. To capture seller consideration of competition, we adapt the cognitive hierarchy framework by modeling sellers' differing abilities to predict how competition affects their decisions. To capture seller consideration of consumer response, we first specify a sales-response model in which sales are affected by the marketing tools used and then incorporate the response parameters in sellers' payoff functions. Our empirical analysis indicates that these two types of strategic considerations are both important. Our estimation results show that, in making decisions on which marketing tool(s) to use, sellers tend to differentiate themselves from the competition. We also find that sellers with a higher rating tend to be more strategic. This finding provides a useful metric associated with firms' strategic ability, which is often difficult to quantify, and helps researchers to test theoretical predictions related to firms' strategic thinking using field data. We perform two comparative statics exercises to derive managerial insights. The first exercise offers a benchmark analysis to help platforms evaluate which targeted promotion strategies are most effective. The second exercise indicates that an increase in seller strategic ability would reduce the overall seller usage of marketing tools, and we offer specific suggestions to help platform managers increase the use of their marketing tools.},

However, they may also fragment a social network, weakening its value added for the platform. We analyze a unique dataset from an online game, which includes multiple snapshots of the players' social network and their community memberships over time. To study the mutual impact between social ties and communities, we build and estimate a model to capture the evolution of social network with communities. The model allows for rich unobserved heterogeneity at the user level. We find that ties are much more likely to form within-community than cross-community. However, in the long term, a great fraction of cross-community ties actually come from within-community tie formation, thanks to the mechanism where individuals maintain ties with previous communities when switching communities. A key factor in this mechanism is mobility, the frequency that individuals switch communities. Building on this insight, we show the platform can achieve stronger connections across its communities by harnessing tie formation within communities.},

On the basis of two large-scale datasets with a total of over 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Study 1 and Study 2 consistently unveil nonlinear effects. While some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too much of them has a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques dealing with selfselection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. Also, such nonlinear effects are different across more vis-{\`a}-vis less experienced individuals. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 unveils that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too much of them can introduce information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.},

The proposed agent-based simulation approach allows for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal recommender systems performance under a variety of diverse conditions, which typically is not feasible with live real-world systems. We specifically focus on exploring the product consumption strategies and show that, over time, user--recommender interactions consistently lead to the longitudinal performance paradox of recommender systems. In particular, users' reliance on the system's recommendations to make item choices generally tends to make the recommender system less useful in the long run or, more specifically, negatively impacts the longitudinal dynamics of several important dimensions of recommendation performance. Furthermore, we explore the nuances of the performance paradox via additional explorations of longitudinal dynamics of recommender systems for a variety of user populations and consumption strategies, as well as personalized and nonpersonalized recommendation approaches. One interesting discovery from our exploration is that a certain hybrid consumption strategy---that is, where users rely on a combination of both personalized- and popularity-based recommendations, offers a unique ability to substantially improve consumption relevance over time. In other words, for such hybrid consumption settings, recommendation algorithms facilitate the general ``quality-rises-to-the-top'' phenomenon, which is not present in the pure popularity-based consumption. In addition to discussing a number of interesting performance patterns, the paper also analyzes and provides insights into the underlying factors that drive such patterns. Our findings have significant implications for the design and implementation of recommender systems.},

Through a combination of experimental study and quantitative modeling of archival social media data, the present study examined the impact of eWOM polarization on consumer new product adoption. Our experimental study shows that eWOM polarization increased consumer attitudinal ambivalence, which in turn decreased new product adoption intention. In our quantitative modeling study, we developed a measure for quantifying eWOM polarization on social media, and estimated its impact on sales of video game consoles. The result replicated the negative impact of eWOM polarization and further showed that the negative impact is more pronounced at the early (vs. later) stage of product life cycle.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: We consider a revenue management problem that arises from the selling of high-speed train tickets in China. Compared with traditional network revenue management problems, the new feature of our problem is the assign-to-seat restric\- tion. That is, each request, if accepted, must be assigned instantly to a single seat throughout the whole journey, and later adjustment is not allowed. When making decisions, the seller needs to track not only the total seat capacity available, but also the status of each seat. Method\- ology/results: We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem. First, we study a static problem in which all requests are given. Although the problem is NP-hard in general, we identify conditions for solvability in polynomial time and propose effi\- cient approximation algorithms for general cases. We then introduce a bid-price control policy based on a novel maximal sequence principle. This policy accommodates nonlinearity in bid prices and, as a result, yields a more accurate approximation of the value function than a tradi\- tional bid-price control policy does. Finally, we combine a dynamic view of the maximal sequence with the static solution of a primal problem to propose a ``re-solving a dynamic primal'' policy that can achieve uniformly bounded revenue loss under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data document the advantage of our pro\- posed policies on resource-allocation efficiency. Managerial implications: The results of this study reveal connections between our problem and traditional network revenue management problems. Particularly, we demonstrate that by adaptively using our proposed methods, the impact of the assign-to-seat restriction becomes limited both in theory and practice.},
