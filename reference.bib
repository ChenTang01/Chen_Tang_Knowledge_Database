  abstract = {We quantify the effects of others' adoptions and word-of-mouth (volume and valence) on consumers' product adoption decisions. We differentiate between the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from friends (``personal network'') and the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from the whole community (``community network''). Understanding the relative importance of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions at each network level provides crucial guidance for companies regarding their information provision and platform design strategies. Our unique data come from an online anime (Japanese cartoon) platform containing individual-level data on users' networks, anime adoptions, forum posts, and ratings of animes. Our results reveal that both word-of-mouth (volume and valence) and observed adoptions from the community network have significant positive effects on individual users' anime watching decisions. Furthermore, this finding also holds true for word-of-mouth and observed adoptions coming from the personal network. Comparing the magnitudes of the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions across both network levels, we find that word-of-mouth valence from the community network is the largest driver among the social learning forces we study. Thus our results show that word-of-mouth and observed adoptions provide unique and different information that individuals use in their anime watching decisions and that the community network is the primary source of information.},

  abstract = {Pricing and availability of tickets have always been a source of confusion for customers in transportation industries. What is the best time to buy tickets? Why passengers taking the same flight might pay significantly different prices for the same seat? Why round trip tickets between two cities sometimes become cheaper than the one-way flights between them? Is it fair to buy a ticket for an itinerary cheaper than a ticket for just a part of it? These observations make customers wonder why they pay higher prices for shorter flights. In this paper, we study the airlines' revenue management systems and explain some of these pricing schemes in travel industries. We develop a simulator to study the decision making process of network revenue management and use a numerical study to explore these questions and address some explanations for them. We relate these observations to the revenue management measurements such as the bid price or the adjustment cost and show how the dynamic of the network get influenced by these measures that eventually results in unusual pricing. We explain how a zero or small bid price of a specific leg may cause the price of an itinerary be cheaper than one segment of it and that the small bid price is caused by low demand in comparison to the available capacity. We exhibit network revenue management system and show the above issues for a small network.},

  abstract = {The current marketing environment is characterized by a surge in multichannel shopping and increasing choice of advertising channels. This situation requires firms to understand how advertising in one channel (e.g., online) influences sales in another channel (e.g., offline). This article studies the presence, magnitude, and carryover of these cross-channel effects for online advertising (display and search) and traditional media. The analysis considers how these advertising expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly through intermediate search advertising metrics{\textemdash}namely, impressions and clickthrough rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities. Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising. Notably, the authors find that traditional advertising decreases paid search click-through rates, thus reducing the net cross effect of traditional advertising.},

  abstract = {In 2013, the global mobile app market was estimated at over US\$50 billion and is expected to grow to \$150 billion in the next two years. In this paper, we build a structural econometric model to quantify the vibrant platform competition between mobile (smartphone and tablet) apps on the Apple iOS and Google Android platforms and estimate consumer preferences toward different mobile app characteristics. We find that app demand increases with the in-app purchase option wherein a user can complete transactions within the app. On the contrary, app demand decreases with the in-app advertisement option where consumers are shown ads while they are engaging with the app. The direct effects on app revenue from the inclusion of an in-app purchase option and an in-app advertisement option are equivalent to offering a 28\% price discount and increasing the price by 8\%, respectively. We also find that a price discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Google Play compared with Apple App Store, and app developers can maximize their revenue by providing a 50\% discount on their paid apps. Using the estimated demand function, we find that mobile apps have enhanced consumer surplus by approximately \$33.6 billion annually in the United States, and we discuss various implications for mobile marketing analytics, app pricing, and app design strategies.             This paper was accepted by Alok Gupta, special issue on business analytics.},

The product adoption decisions of friends and strangers can both strongly in uence consumers' purchase behaviour, but their importance relative to each other is unknown. We rst collect novel data on microtransactions in an online gaming app to quantify the lift in purchase probability from observing friends' and strangers' product adoption choices. To isolate exogenous exposure to peers' product adoptions, we leverage the app's quasi-random matchmaking system. Observing a friend's product adoption has twice the marginal e ect on purchase probability as observing a stranger's product adoption, but the cumulative e ect from observing strangers' product adoptions is much larger over time. We then calibrate a di usion model using the in-app social network of 9.4 million players. We nd that seeding products to active players who interact with more strangers generates almost four times the number of net new adoptions compared to seeding to players who are more central in the social network.},

However, the link between dealers' service quality and manufacturer performance is not well understood.

Others posit that dealer services are a commodity, and their quality may only affect sales in the extremes. We constructed data representing sales and service quality ratings of 1078 U.S. automobile dealerships over a year in five different car classes. We find that the quality of after-sales services positively influences sales of the brand in the dealer's region. Manufacturers whose dealers struggle with after-sales services take a hit in market share even in markets where they enjoy superior competitive status. We also find that sales-related services gain importance in highly competitive markets where the manufacturer has few dealers and competitors have many.},

We use a market response model and a dataset of economy class reservations from a major international airline to empirically examine the demand and cannibalization effects of the opaque channel. We find that: (1) the impact of the opaque channel on total demand is positive and significant in markets with high levels of competition; and (2) overall, the opaque channel cannibalizes the online transparent channel, but not the offline channel nor the full-fare segment. However, we find that cannibalization of the offline channel moderately increases as markets become more concentrated. These results together suggest that airlines can benefit from opaque offerings mainly in markets with high levels of competition. Further, we develop a methodology to assess the revenue impacts of the opaque channel and show how it can be used by managers to develop and implement pricing tactics to increase demand and decrease cannibalization.},

This paper builds upon the classic labor-leisure model to capture players' dual experience of enjoying leisure and earning virtual currency when playing digital games. We examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior and social welfare, relating players' demand for in-game virtual currency to three key game characteristics {\textendash} virtual wealth satiation point, rate of generating virtual currency, and rate of generating leisure. Our results suggest that the game provider can increase her profits by reducing the virtual currency's price and increasing the number of available virtual items. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing times for the majority of players, which helps alleviate the risk of excessive gaming. Selling virtual currency also leads to a larger player base and more people enjoy the many benefits from playing digital games. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a ``win-win-win'' situation for the game provider, players, and society.},

In the first stage, we build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers' latent engagement state and the state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal dataset obtained from a major international video gaming company, which contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing history over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium- and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer's current engagement state ``on the fly'' and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4-8\% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.},

The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group's realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents' preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms, and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have of others' preferences and actions.},

  abstract = {Many of the products introduced during the past two decades have been services rather than goods. An important influence on the growth and long-term profits of these services is customer attrition, which can occur at the category level (disadoption) or between firms (churn). However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms ina competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firmand apply itto valuation of firmsoperating incompetitive industries. The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role of customer equity invaluations of growing service firms.},

The authors adopt a recently developed morphing technique to measure a product's aesthetic design and investigate its effect on consumer preference. Drawing upon categorization theory, the authors consider the effects of three dimensions of aesthetic design{\textemdash}segment prototypicality (SP), brand consistency (BC), and cross-segment mimicry (CSM){\textemdash}and their moderating effects on marketing mix effectiveness in a unified framework. The empirical analysis uses a unique, large data set consisting of 202 car models from 33 brands sold in the United States from 2003 to 2010. The authors find that consumer preference peaks at moderate levels of SP and BC and that economy-segment products benefit from CSM of luxury products. Moreover, SP intensifies price sensitivity, and BC muffles price sensitivity while increasing advertising effectiveness. Two what-if studies illustrate how managers can use the empirical model to evaluate alternative aesthetic design choices.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Revenue management in railways distinguishes itself from that in traditional sectors, such as airline, hotel, and fashion retail, in several important ways. (i) Capacity is substantially more flexible in the sense that changes to the capacity of a train can often be made throughout the sales horizon. Consequently, the joint optimization of prices and capacity assumes genuine importance. (ii) Capacity can only be added in dis\- crete ``chunks'' (i.e., coaches). (iii) Passengers with unreserved tickets can travel in any of the multiple trains available during the day. Further, passengers in unreserved coaches are allowed to travel by standing, thus giving rise to the need to manage congestion. Moti\- vated by our work with a major railway company in Japan, we analyze the problem of jointly optimizing pricing and capacity; this problem is more-general version of the canoni\- cal multiproduct dynamic-pricing problem. Methodology/results: Our analysis yields four asymptotically optimal policies. From the viewpoint of the pricing decisions, our policies can be classified into two types{\textemdash}static and dynamic. With respect to the timing of the capacity decisions, our policies are again of two types{\textemdash}fixed capacity and flexible capacity. We establish the convergence rates of these policies; when demand and supply ar√e fisfificaled by a factor {$\kappa$} {$\in$} N, the optimality gaps of the static policies scale proportional to {$\kappa$}, and those of the dynamic policies scale proportional to log {$\kappa$}. We illustrate the attractive perfor\- mance of our policies on a test suite of instances based on real-world operations of the high-speed ``Shinkansen'' trains in Japan and develop associated insights. Managerial implications: Our work provides railway administrators with simple and effective policies for pricing, capacity, and congestion management. Our policies cater to different contin\- gencies that decision makers may face in practice: the need for static or dynamic prices and for fixed or flexible capacity.},

  abstract = {We study the spread of misinformation in a social network characterized by unequal access to learning resources. Agents use social learning to uncover an unknown state of the world, and a principal strategically injects misinformation into the network to distort this learning process. A subset of agents throughout the network is endowed with knowledge of the true state. This gives rise to a natural definition of inequality: privileged communities have unrestricted access to these agents, whereas marginalized communities do not. We show that the role that this inequality plays in the spread of misinformation is highly complex. For instance, communities who hoard resources and deny them to the larger population can end up exposing themselves to more misinformation. Conversely, although more inequality generally leads to worse outcomes, the prevalence of misinformation in society is nonmonotone in the level of inequality. This implies that policies that decrease inequality without substantially reducing it can leave society more vulnerable to misinformation.

We find that when faced with information on peer choices, consumers update their attribute preferences in a Bayesian manner. This suggests that greater uncertainty in the attribute preferences of a focal consumer and lesser uncertainty in preferences of peers both lead to greater preference revision. Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision, although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable. Online social network membership and frequency of peer interactions provide better proxies than more common demographic similarity measures. These findings have key implications, especially for word-of-mouth marketing.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Games are the fastest-growing sector of the entertainment industry. Freemium games are the fastest-growing segment within games. The concept behind freemium is to attract large pools of players, many of whom will never spend money on the game. When game publishers cannot earn directly from the pockets of consumers, they employ other revenue-generating content, such as advertising. Players can become irritated by revenue-generating content. A recent innovation is to offer incentives for players to interact with such content, such as clicking an ad or watching a video. These are termed incentivized (incented) actions. We study the optimal deployment of incented actions. Academic/practical relevance: Removing or adding incented actions can essentially be done in real-time. Accordingly, the deployment of incented actions is a tactical, operational question for game designers. Methodology: We model the deployment problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study the performance of simple policies, as well as the structure of optimal policies. We use a proprietary data set to calibrate our MDP and derive insights. Results: Cannibalization{\textemdash}the degree to which incented actions distract players from making in-app purchases{\textemdash}is the key parameter for determining how to deploy incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to offer incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently low, it is always optimal to offer. We find sufficient conditions for the optimality of threshold strategies that offer incented actions to low-engagement users and later remove them once a player is sufficiently engaged. Managerial implications: This research introduces operations management academics to a new class of operational issues in the games industry. Managers in the games industry can gain insights into when incentivized actions can be more or less effective. Game designers can use our MDP model to make data-driven decisions for deploying incented actions.},

For this purpose, we first state the choice-based network revenue management problem by formulating the underlying dynamic program, and structure the review according to its components and the resulting inherent challenges. In particular, we first focus on the demand modeling by giving an overview of popular choice models, discussing their properties, and describing estimation procedures relevant to choice-based revenue management. Second, we elaborate on assortment optimization, which is a fundamental component of the problem. Third, we describe recent developments on tackling the entire control problem. We also discuss the relation to dynamic pricing. Finally, we give directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Sales promotions generate substantial short-term sales increases. To determine whether the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross-period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find that each of these three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease.},

  abstract = {Network externality arises when the utility of a product depends not only on its attributes but also on the number of consumers who purchase the same product. In this paper, we study consumer choice models that endogenize such network externality. We first characterize the choice probabilities under such models and conduct studies on comparative statics. Then we investigate the assortment optimization problem under such choice models. Although the problem is generally NP-hard, we show that a new class of assortments, called quasi-revenue-ordered assortments, which consist of a revenue-ordered assortment plus at most one additional item, are optimal under mild conditions. We also propose an iterative estimation method to calibrate such choice models, for both uncensored and censored data cases. An empirical study on a mobile game data set shows that our proposed model can provide better fits for the data, increase the prediction accuracy for consumer choices, and potentially increase revenue.

  abstract = {Problem definition: Qualcomm, the largest cellphone chipmaker in the world, had adopted a cross-licensing agreement with its clients, downstream cellphone manufacturers. It requires cellphone manufacturers to allow each other to use their patents for free. This cross-licensing practice has received considerable scrutiny and attention around the world. We study the impacts of cross-licensing in a supply chain in which an upstream supplier requires its downstream competing manufacturers to cross-license, where they are asymmetric in their innovation capabilities. Academic/practical relevance: Our study helps firms and policy makers better understand the implications of cross-licensing and provides practical guidelines. Methodology: We build a stylized model of a supply chain consisting of one supplier and two competing manufacturers, and conduct game-theoretic analysis. Results: The supplier always prefers adopting cross-licensing ex-post after manufacturers' investments are sunk, but it may prefer committing to no cross-licensing ex-ante. Specifically, the supplier should commit to not using cross-licensing if the inferior manufacturer's cost of innovation is high or the effectiveness of cross-licensing is high. Furthermore, cross-licensing may increase innovation, the superior manufacturer's profit, and social welfare under certain conditions. Interestingly, when the superior manufacturer's cost advantage is intermediate, the inferior manufacturer's innovation level first increases andthen decreases in the effectiveness of cross-licensing. In addition, the inferior manufacturer's profit also first increases and then decreases as the effectiveness level of cross-licensing increases. The cross-licensing policy benefits consumers when its effectiveness level is low and the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either high or low. Managerial implications: Our results provide guidance on when a supplier should adopt the cross-licensing strategy. For policy makers, our findings show that cross-licensing can be beneficial forconsumers and the society. In particular, to increase social welfare, policy makers may consider encouraging cross-licensing with low effectiveness level when the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either low or high.},

  abstract = {Social media platforms for healthcare services are changing how patients choose physicians. The digitization of healthcare reviews has been providing additional information to patients when choosing their physicians. On the other hand, the growing online information introduces more uncertainty among providers regarding the expected future demand and how different service features can affect patient decisions. In this paper, we derive various service-quality proxies from online reviews and show that leveraging textual information can derive useful operational measures to better understand patient choices. To do so, we study a unique data set from one of the leading appointment-booking websites in the United States. We derive from the text reviews the seven most frequently mentioned topics among patients, namely, bedside manner, diagnosis accuracy, waiting time, service time, insurance process, physician knowledge, and office environment, and then incorporate these service features into a random-coefficient choice model to quantify the economic values of these service-quality proxies. By introducing quality proxies from text reviews, we find the predictive power of patient choice increases significantly, for example, a 6\%{\textendash}12\% improvement measured by mean squared error for both in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, our estimation results indicate that contextual description may better characterize users' perceived quality than numerical ratings on the same service feature. Broadly speaking, this paper shows how to incorporate textual information into an econometric model to understand patient choice in healthcare delivery. Our interdisciplinary approach provides a framework that combines machine learning and structural modeling techniques to advance the literature in empirical operations management, information systems, and marketing.},

However, they may also fragment a social network, weakening its value added for the platform. We analyze a unique dataset from an online game, which includes multiple snapshots of the players' social network and their community memberships over time. To study the mutual impact between social ties and communities, we build and estimate a model to capture the evolution of social network with communities. The model allows for rich unobserved heterogeneity at the user level. We find that ties are much more likely to form within-community than cross-community. However, in the long term, a great fraction of cross-community ties actually come from within-community tie formation, thanks to the mechanism where individuals maintain ties with previous communities when switching communities. A key factor in this mechanism is mobility, the frequency that individuals switch communities. Building on this insight, we show the platform can achieve stronger connections across its communities by harnessing tie formation within communities.},

On the basis of two large-scale datasets with a total of over 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Study 1 and Study 2 consistently unveil nonlinear effects. While some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too much of them has a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques dealing with selfselection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. Also, such nonlinear effects are different across more vis-{\`a}-vis less experienced individuals. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 unveils that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too much of them can introduce information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Prior marketing research on eWOM has focused on the effect of overall sentiment (valence) of online conversation on product or brand performance, whereas little research has examined the impact of sentiment polarization, that is, the degree to which positive and negative sentiments are simultaneously strong. Through a combination of experimental study and quantitative modeling of archival social media data, the present study examined the impact of eWOM polarization on consumer new product adoption. Our experimental study shows that eWOM polarization increased consumer attitudinal ambivalence, which in turn decreased new product adoption intention. In our quantitative modeling study, we developed a measure for quantifying eWOM polarization on social media, and estimated its impact on sales of video game consoles. The result replicated the negative impact of eWOM polarization and further showed that the negative impact is more pronounced at the early (vs. later) stage of product life cycle.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: We consider a revenue management problem that arises from the selling of high-speed train tickets in China. Compared with traditional network revenue management problems, the new feature of our problem is the assign-to-seat restric\- tion. That is, each request, if accepted, must be assigned instantly to a single seat throughout the whole journey, and later adjustment is not allowed. When making decisions, the seller needs to track not only the total seat capacity available, but also the status of each seat. Method\- ology/results: We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem. First, we study a static problem in which all requests are given. Although the problem is NP-hard in general, we identify conditions for solvability in polynomial time and propose effi\- cient approximation algorithms for general cases. We then introduce a bid-price control policy based on a novel maximal sequence principle. This policy accommodates nonlinearity in bid prices and, as a result, yields a more accurate approximation of the value function than a tradi\- tional bid-price control policy does. Finally, we combine a dynamic view of the maximal sequence with the static solution of a primal problem to propose a ``re-solving a dynamic primal'' policy that can achieve uniformly bounded revenue loss under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data document the advantage of our pro\- posed policies on resource-allocation efficiency. Managerial implications: The results of this study reveal connections between our problem and traditional network revenue management problems. Particularly, we demonstrate that by adaptively using our proposed methods, the impact of the assign-to-seat restriction becomes limited both in theory and practice.},
