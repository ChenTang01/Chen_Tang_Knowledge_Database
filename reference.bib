  abstract = {We quantify the effects of others' adoptions and word-of-mouth (volume and valence) on consumers' product adoption decisions. We differentiate between the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from friends (``personal network'') and the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions from the whole community (``community network''). Understanding the relative importance of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions at each network level provides crucial guidance for companies regarding their information provision and platform design strategies. Our unique data come from an online anime (Japanese cartoon) platform containing individual-level data on users' networks, anime adoptions, forum posts, and ratings of animes. Our results reveal that both word-of-mouth (volume and valence) and observed adoptions from the community network have significant positive effects on individual users' anime watching decisions. Furthermore, this finding also holds true for word-of-mouth and observed adoptions coming from the personal network. Comparing the magnitudes of the effects of word-of-mouth and observed adoptions across both network levels, we find that word-of-mouth valence from the community network is the largest driver among the social learning forces we study. Thus our results show that word-of-mouth and observed adoptions provide unique and different information that individuals use in their anime watching decisions and that the community network is the primary source of information.},

  abstract = {We compare the performance of two approaches for finding the optimal set of products to display to customers landing on Alibaba's two online marketplaces, Tmall and Taobao. Both approaches were placed online simultaneously and tested on real customers for one week. The first approach we test is Alibaba's current practice. This procedure embeds thousands of product and customer features within a sophisticated machine learning algorithm that is used to estimate the purchase probabilities of each product for the customer at hand. The products with the largest expected revenue (revenue \texttimes{} predicted purchase probability) are then made available for purchase. The downside of this approach is that it does not incorporate customer substitution patterns; the estimates of the purchase probabilities are independent of the set of products that eventually are displayed. Our second approach uses a featurized multinomial logit (MNL) model to predict purchase probabilities for each arriving customer. In this way we use less sophisticated machinery to estimate purchase probabilities, but we employ a model that was built to capture customer purchasing behavior and, more specifically, substitution patterns. We use historical sales data to fit the MNL model and then, for each arriving customer, we solve the cardinality-constrained assortment optimization problem under the MNL model online to find the optimal set of products to display. Our experiments show that despite the lower prediction power of our MNL-based approach, it generates significantly higher revenue per visit compared to the current machine learning algorithm with the same set of features. We also conduct various heterogeneous-treatment-effect analyses to demonstrate that the current MNL approach performs best for sellers whose customers generally only make a single purchase.},

  abstract = {We provide a new framework to identify demand elasticities in markets where managers rely on algorithmic recommendations for price setting, and apply it to a dataset containing bookings for a sample of mid-sized hotels in Europe. Using non-binding algorithmic price recommendations and observed delay in price adjustments by decision makers, we demonstrate that a control-function approach, combined with state-of-the-art model selection techniques, can be used to isolate exogenous price variation and identify demand elasticities across hotel room types and over time. We confirm these elasticity estimates with a difference-in-differences approach that leverages the same delays in price adjustments by decision makers. However, the difference-in-differences estimates are more noisy and only yield consistent estimates if data is pooled across hotels. We then apply our control-function approach to two classic questions in the dynamic pricing literature: the evolution of price elasticity of demand over time as well as the effects of a transitory price change on future demand due to the presence of strategic buyers. Finally, we discuss {${_\ast}$} The authors thank the corporate sponsor for making the data available for this project.

The product adoption decisions of friends and strangers can both strongly in uence consumers' purchase behaviour, but their importance relative to each other is unknown. We rst collect novel data on microtransactions in an online gaming app to quantify the lift in purchase probability from observing friends' and strangers' product adoption choices. To isolate exogenous exposure to peers' product adoptions, we leverage the app's quasi-random matchmaking system. Observing a friend's product adoption has twice the marginal e ect on purchase probability as observing a stranger's product adoption, but the cumulative e ect from observing strangers' product adoptions is much larger over time. We then calibrate a di usion model using the in-app social network of 9.4 million players. We nd that seeding products to active players who interact with more strangers generates almost four times the number of net new adoptions compared to seeding to players who are more central in the social network.},

This paper builds upon the classic labor-leisure model to capture players' dual experience of enjoying leisure and earning virtual currency when playing digital games. We examine the impact of selling virtual currency on players' gameplay behavior and social welfare, relating players' demand for in-game virtual currency to three key game characteristics \textendash{} virtual wealth satiation point, rate of generating virtual currency, and rate of generating leisure. Our results suggest that the game provider can increase her profits by reducing the virtual currency's price and increasing the number of available virtual items. We find that selling virtual currency reduces the playing times for the majority of players, which helps alleviate the risk of excessive gaming. Selling virtual currency also leads to a larger player base and more people enjoy the many benefits from playing digital games. Finally, we demonstrate that selling virtual currency could lead to a ``win-win-win'' situation for the game provider, players, and society.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel two-stage data analytic modeling approach, combining theories, statistical analysis and optimization techniques to model player engagement as a function of motivation to maximize customer game-play via matching in the large and growing online video game industry. In the first stage, we build a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on theories of customer engagement and gamer motivation to capture the evolution of gamers' latent engagement state and the state-dependent participation behavior. We then calibrate the HMM using a longitudinal dataset obtained from a major international video gaming company, which contains detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing history over a period of 29 months comprising more than 700,000 unique game rounds. We find that high-, medium- and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations such as feelings of effectance and need for challenge. In the second stage, we use the results from the first stage to develop a matching algorithm that learns (infers) the gamer's current engagement state ``on the fly'' and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4-8\% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.},

  abstract = {The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group's realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents' preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms, and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have of others' preferences and actions.},

An important influence on the growth and long-term profits of these services is customer attrition, which can occur at the category level (disadoption) or between firms (churn). However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms ina competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firmand apply itto valuation of firmsoperating incompetitive industries. The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role of customer equity invaluations of growing service firms.},

Agents use social learning to uncover an unknown state of the world, and a principal strategically injects misinformation into the network to distort this learning process. A subset of agents throughout the network is endowed with knowledge of the true state. This gives rise to a natural definition of inequality: privileged communities have unrestricted access to these agents, whereas marginalized communities do not. We show that the role that this inequality plays in the spread of misinformation is highly complex. For instance, communities who hoard resources and deny them to the larger population can end up exposing themselves to more misinformation. Conversely, although more inequality generally leads to worse outcomes, the prevalence of misinformation in society is nonmonotone in the level of inequality. This implies that policies that decrease inequality without substantially reducing it can leave society more vulnerable to misinformation.

We find that when faced with information on peer choices, consumers update their attribute preferences in a Bayesian manner. This suggests that greater uncertainty in the attribute preferences of a focal consumer and lesser uncertainty in preferences of peers both lead to greater preference revision. Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision, although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable. Online social network membership and frequency of peer interactions provide better proxies than more common demographic similarity measures. These findings have key implications, especially for word-of-mouth marketing.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Games are the fastest-growing sector of the entertainment industry. Freemium games are the fastest-growing segment within games. The concept behind freemium is to attract large pools of players, many of whom will never spend money on the game. When game publishers cannot earn directly from the pockets of consumers, they employ other revenue-generating content, such as advertising. Players can become irritated by revenue-generating content. A recent innovation is to offer incentives for players to interact with such content, such as clicking an ad or watching a video. These are termed incentivized (incented) actions. We study the optimal deployment of incented actions. Academic/practical relevance: Removing or adding incented actions can essentially be done in real-time. Accordingly, the deployment of incented actions is a tactical, operational question for game designers. Methodology: We model the deployment problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). We study the performance of simple policies, as well as the structure of optimal policies. We use a proprietary data set to calibrate our MDP and derive insights. Results: Cannibalization\textemdash the degree to which incented actions distract players from making in-app purchases\textemdash is the key parameter for determining how to deploy incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently high, it is never optimal to offer incented actions. If cannibalization is sufficiently low, it is always optimal to offer. We find sufficient conditions for the optimality of threshold strategies that offer incented actions to low-engagement users and later remove them once a player is sufficiently engaged. Managerial implications: This research introduces operations management academics to a new class of operational issues in the games industry. Managers in the games industry can gain insights into when incentivized actions can be more or less effective. Game designers can use our MDP model to make data-driven decisions for deploying incented actions.},

For this purpose, we first state the choice-based network revenue management problem by formulating the underlying dynamic program, and structure the review according to its components and the resulting inherent challenges. In particular, we first focus on the demand modeling by giving an overview of popular choice models, discussing their properties, and describing estimation procedures relevant to choice-based revenue management. Second, we elaborate on assortment optimization, which is a fundamental component of the problem. Third, we describe recent developments on tackling the entire control problem. We also discuss the relation to dynamic pricing. Finally, we give directions for future research.},

In this paper, we study consumer choice models that endogenize such network externality. We first characterize the choice probabilities under such models and conduct studies on comparative statics. Then we investigate the assortment optimization problem under such choice models. Although the problem is generally NP-hard, we show that a new class of assortments, called quasi-revenue-ordered assortments, which consist of a revenue-ordered assortment plus at most one additional item, are optimal under mild conditions. We also propose an iterative estimation method to calibrate such choice models, for both uncensored and censored data cases. An empirical study on a mobile game data set shows that our proposed model can provide better fits for the data, increase the prediction accuracy for consumer choices, and potentially increase revenue.

  abstract = {Problem definition: Qualcomm, the largest cellphone chipmaker in the world, had adopted a cross-licensing agreement with its clients, downstream cellphone manufacturers. It requires cellphone manufacturers to allow each other to use their patents for free. This cross-licensing practice has received considerable scrutiny and attention around the world. We study the impacts of cross-licensing in a supply chain in which an upstream supplier requires its downstream competing manufacturers to cross-license, where they are asymmetric in their innovation capabilities. Academic/practical relevance: Our study helps firms and policy makers better understand the implications of cross-licensing and provides practical guidelines. Methodology: We build a stylized model of a supply chain consisting of one supplier and two competing manufacturers, and conduct game-theoretic analysis. Results: The supplier always prefers adopting cross-licensing ex-post after manufacturers' investments are sunk, but it may prefer committing to no cross-licensing ex-ante. Specifically, the supplier should commit to not using cross-licensing if the inferior manufacturer's cost of innovation is high or the effectiveness of cross-licensing is high. Furthermore, cross-licensing may increase innovation, the superior manufacturer's profit, and social welfare under certain conditions. Interestingly, when the superior manufacturer's cost advantage is intermediate, the inferior manufacturer's innovation level first increases andthen decreases in the effectiveness of cross-licensing. In addition, the inferior manufacturer's profit also first increases and then decreases as the effectiveness level of cross-licensing increases. The cross-licensing policy benefits consumers when its effectiveness level is low and the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either high or low. Managerial implications: Our results provide guidance on when a supplier should adopt the cross-licensing strategy. For policy makers, our findings show that cross-licensing can be beneficial forconsumers and the society. In particular, to increase social welfare, policy makers may consider encouraging cross-licensing with low effectiveness level when the superior manufacturer's innovation cost is either low or high.},

  abstract = {More and more online platforms allow users to not only befriend each other but also form groups or communities. Communities can encourage user engagement. However, they may also fragment a social network, weakening its value added for the platform. We analyze a unique dataset from an online game, which includes multiple snapshots of the players' social network and their community memberships over time. To study the mutual impact between social ties and communities, we build and estimate a model to capture the evolution of social network with communities. The model allows for rich unobserved heterogeneity at the user level. We find that ties are much more likely to form within-community than cross-community. However, in the long term, a great fraction of cross-community ties actually come from within-community tie formation, thanks to the mechanism where individuals maintain ties with previous communities when switching communities. A key factor in this mechanism is mobility, the frequency that individuals switch communities. Building on this insight, we show the platform can achieve stronger connections across its communities by harnessing tie formation within communities.},

  abstract = {Although it seems intuitive for firms to leverage social connections and interactions to influence consumers' goal attainment and spending, the authors present a caveat of such effects. On the basis of two large-scale datasets with a total of over 5 million people-day observations from online gaming markets, Study 1 and Study 2 consistently unveil nonlinear effects. While some social connections and interactions boost goal attainment and spending (positive linear term), after a certain point too much of them has a diminished marginal effect (negative squared term). The results are robust to a wide array of modeling techniques dealing with selfselection, unobserved individual heterogeneity, and endogeneity. Also, such nonlinear effects are different across more vis-\`a-vis less experienced individuals. Regarding the underlying mechanism, the follow-up experiment Study 3 unveils that consistent with the information processing theory, some social connections and interactions can provide information support for goal attainment, but too much of them can introduce information overload problem and, thus, hamper goal attainment intention. Together, these findings refute a simple, linear view of the effects of social connections and interactions and provide pivotal theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Prior marketing research on eWOM has focused on the effect of overall sentiment (valence) of online conversation on product or brand performance, whereas little research has examined the impact of sentiment polarization, that is, the degree to which positive and negative sentiments are simultaneously strong. Through a combination of experimental study and quantitative modeling of archival social media data, the present study examined the impact of eWOM polarization on consumer new product adoption. Our experimental study shows that eWOM polarization increased consumer attitudinal ambivalence, which in turn decreased new product adoption intention. In our quantitative modeling study, we developed a measure for quantifying eWOM polarization on social media, and estimated its impact on sales of video game consoles. The result replicated the negative impact of eWOM polarization and further showed that the negative impact is more pronounced at the early (vs. later) stage of product life cycle.},
